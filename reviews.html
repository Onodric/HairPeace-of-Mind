					<h3>Donald Trump</h3>
					<p>These toupe&eacute;s are great, they're really the best. Believe me, I know toupe&eacute;s, and these are just the best toupe&eacute;s. Your reputation is gonna be yuge if you wear this hair. Believe me, I know. I was walking around yesterday and my girl Hillary told me, "Donald, your hair looks great. It really looks great." So believe me, you're gonna love these toupe&eacute;s. They really are the best toupe&eacute;s.</p>

					<h3>Harry McWiggerson</h3>
					<p>I don't wear a toupe&eacute;! But, if I did, you could rest assured that I would buy it from HairPeace of Mind. Again, this IS my natural hair, but I know that if I wasn't born with such beautiful locks, this place would certainly be my toupe&eacute; supplier.</p>

					<h3>Smooth Dan</h3>
					<p>All of the ladies love my hair. If it wasn't for HairPeace of Mind, I probably wouldn't have five supermodel wives.</p>

					<h3>Nathan Rugs</h3>
					<p>I'm a big fan of the levitating model. It allows me to show off my scalp while also sporting a beautiful head of hair. It's like having your cake and eating it too!</p>
